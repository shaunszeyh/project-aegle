    # Project Aegle
    Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ This website calculates your risk of stroke and gives you some suggestions to lower it!\n
    **ðŸ‘ˆ Click on the arrow** on the top left to navigate to the site to calculate your risk.
    ## Stats about strokes
    - In Singapore, stroke is the **fourth** most common cause of death
    - Accounts for more than **10%** of all deaths
    - **26** new stroke cases per day in SG
    - This number will only **increase** with our rising ageing population
    - According to research, early prediction and prevention highly effective in reducing incidence rate
    ## About the data used
    - Our model is generated from the dataset found from the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
    - Data is taken from more than 5000 people from India (We would have taken it from SG if this data was readily available)
    - Datapoints are gender, age, hypertension status, heart disease status, marriage status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, bmi and smoking status
    ### Breakdown of the data
